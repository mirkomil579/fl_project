## MLDL24 Federated Learning Project: Impact of Data and System Heterogeneity on Federated Learning

The project evaluates the impact of Federated Learning on model accuracy and loss across different epochs, providing a comprehensive analysis of its feasibility and limitations. By addressing these challenges, this project aims to contribute to the understanding and application of Federated Learning in real-world machine learning scenarios.

## Datasets

1. CIFAR-100

  * **Overview:** consists of 60,000 color images, each of size 32Ã—32 pixels
  * **Details:** 100 fine-grained classes
  * **Task:** Computer Vision Task

2. Shakespeare

  * **Overview:** Text Dataset of Shakespeare Dialogues
  * **Details:** 1129 users (reduced to 660 with our choice of sequence length.
  * **Task:** Next-Character Prediction

## Parameters:

- `K` number of clients
- `C` portion of clients selected in each round
- `B` local batch size
- `N` total number of communication rounds
- `J` number of local epochs
- `lr` learning rate
- `test_freq` testing frequency
- `participation` mode of client participation: `uniform` or `skewed`
- `gamma` scale of skewness in the case of skewed participation, otherwise ignored

Additional parameters concerning data splitting for CIFAR-100 are stored in `data_split_params`:
- `shard_type` method of splitting data: `iid` or `non-iid`
- `n_labels` number of labels per client in the case of non-IID data distribution
